/**
 * A Wrapped Command is like the Command struct defined in the C version
 * in the file generic/tclInt.h. It is "wrapped" around a TclJava Command
 * interface reference. We need to wrap Command references so that we
 * can keep track of sticky issues like what namespace the command is
 * defined in without requiring that every implementation of a Command
 * interface provide method to do this. This class is only used in
 * the internal implementation of Jacl.
